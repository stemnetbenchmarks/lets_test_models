Typical values for z are in the range of 0.9 to 0.95. A value of 1.0 would include all tokens, 
and thus disables the effect of TFS.
Tail free sampling (TFS) is a text generation technique that 
aims to reduce the impact of less likely tokens, 
which may be less relevant, less coherent, or nonsensical, on the output. Similar to Top-P 
it tries to determine the bulk of the most likely tokens dynamically. 
But TFS filters out logits based on the second derivative of their probabilities. 
Adding tokens is stopped after the sum of the second derivatives reaches the parameter z. 
In short: TFS looks how quickly the probabilities of the tokens decrease 
and cuts off the tail of unlikely tokensusing the parameter z. 
Typical values for z are in the range of 0.9 to 0.95. A value of 1.0 would include all tokens, 
and thus disables the effect of TFS.

"""
By setting the parameter p between 0 and 1, you can control the balance between producing text that is locally coherent and diverse. 
A value closer to 1 will promote more contextually coherent tokens, 
while a value closer to 0 will promote more diverse tokens. 
A value equal to 1 disables locally typical sampling.

"""
Mirostat is an algorithm that actively maintains the quality of 
generated text within a desired range during text generation. 
It aims to strike a balance between coherence and diversity, 
avoiding low-quality output caused by excessive repetition 
(boredom traps) or incoherence (confusion traps).

The --mirostat-lr option sets the Mirostat learning rate (eta). 
The learning rate influences how quickly the algorithm responds to feedback from the generated text.
 A lower learning rate will result in slower adjustments, 
 while a higher learning rate will make the algorithm more responsive. The default value is 0.1.

The --mirostat-ent option sets the Mirostat target entropy (tau), 
which represents the desired perplexity value for the generated text. 
Adjusting the target entropy allows you to control the balance between
 coherence and diversity in the generated text. A lower value will result 
 in more focused and coherent text, while a higher value will lead to more
  diverse and potentially less coherent text. The default value is 5.0.
